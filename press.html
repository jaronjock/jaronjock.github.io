            <h2>About</h2>

            <p>
                With a message to send and a spectacular voice to deliver, vocalist and songwriter Kalysta, discovered
                her musical passion at the young age of six. Hailing from Michigan, Kalysta was raised on Motown
                oldies, the greats of the Big Band era, and her all-time favorite, contemporary R&B and Soul. Kalysta
                has been in numerous choirs, trained classically in piano, and has performed at many influential and corporate events the past several years.</p>
            <p>
                With her roots in Motown, Kalysta is prepared to take the world by storm by sharing her talent and
                energy with fans. Honoring iconic women in the industry from Aretha Franklin, to Amy Winehouse, she
                is also inspired by current masters of music, such as Bruno Mars and Ariana Grande.
                Kalysta earned the award for Best Jazz Vocalist at the 2020 and 2021 Great Lakes Bay Region Review
                Music Awards. Kalysta's currently released music has been featured on college radio, spanning from
                Michigan to California. Her songs were included on the Top Ten R&B Playlist at Old Dominion College in Virginia.</p>
            <p>
                Kalysta records at Rustbelt Studios in Detroit, MI and also at Audioasis Studios in Bristol, TN. When
                she is not recording her original music, Kalysta is working on her upcoming album and performing
                with her live band state-wide at countless venues. Her live performances include her original music,
                Aretha Franklin, Stevie Wonder, Elton John, and soulful renditions of the popular classics we all love.
                Kalysta's message? She would love to see her soulful music continue to unite fans from all backgrounds to find togetherness and joy.</p>
