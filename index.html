        <h2 style="color:white">About</h2>
        <p style="color:white">I work with clients experiencing a wide range of challenges. Some clients come to me because they have a painful past filled with grief, guilt, or trauma. Some of my clients have challenging current circumstances, like troubled relationships, unfulfilling careers, and addiction to substances and behaviors. Some of my clients come to me because they are bogged down by sticky emotions like depression, anxiety, and anger. Some days I am helping clients speak or compete in front of thousands of people, other days I am helping clients get out of bed to start the day.
          I have certificates from the Beck Institute and Russ Harris, the premier training institutes and individuals in the world in CBT and ACT. These trainings cover depression, anxiety, trauma, grief, addiction, anger, pain, and personality disorders. I have additional certificates of training on various topics and do continuing education and research yearly.
          I work with my clients to develop skills and behaviors to learn to make space and accept the painful parts of life, to be mindful and connect with their present moment, and to take value-based action to live a fulfilling life. I offer free consultation by phone and would love the opportunity to work with you.</p>
